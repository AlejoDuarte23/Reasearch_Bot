        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Condition monitoring plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and optimal performance of various engineering systems. Traditional methods for condition monitoring rely on physics-based models and statistical analysis techniques. However, these approaches often face challenges in dealing with complex systems and the limited availability of accurate physical models. In recent years, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising approach for condition monitoring, combining the strengths of physics-based modelling and data-driven machine learning. This study presents a comprehensive overview of PIML techniques in the context of condition monitoring. The central concept driving PIML is the incorporation of known physical laws and constraints into machine learning algorithms, enabling them to learn from available data while remaining consistent with physical principles. Through fusing domain knowledge with data-driven learning, PIML methods offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability in comparison to purely data-driven approaches. In this comprehensive survey, detailed examinations are performed with regard to the methodology by which known physical principles are integrated within machine learning frameworks, as well as their suitability for specific tasks within condition monitoring. Incorporation of physical knowledge into the ML model may be realized in a variety of methods, with each having its unique advantages and drawbacks. The distinct advantages and limitations of each methodology for the integration of physics within data-driven models are detailed, considering factors such as computational efficiency, model interpretability, and generalizability to different systems in condition monitoring and fault detection. Several case studies and works of literature utilizing this emerging concept are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of PIML in condition monitoring applications. From the literature reviewed, the versatility and potential of PIML in condition monitoring may be demonstrated. Novel PIML methods offer an innovative solution for addressing the complexities of condition monitoring and associated challenges. This comprehensive survey helps form the foundation for future work in the field. As the technology continues to advance, PIML is expected to play a crucial role in enhancing maintenance strategies, system reliability, and overall operational efficiency in engineering systems.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  Since the matching between the complex permittivity and permeability plays a dominant role in the performance of microwave absorbing, magnetic-dielectric materials have been increasingly used for microwave absorption. In this paper, Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes (Fe3O4@CNTs) were fabricated via a self-assembled technique. The efficient microwave-absorbing fabric was synthesized by building polyaniline nanofibers (PANI NFs) and Fe3O4@CNTs magnetic–dielectric network on the surface of polyimide (PI) fabric. The results of SEM, FTIR, and XRD demonstrated the presence of Fe3O4@CNTs on the fabric surface. The decomposition temperature (Td
                     ) of the fabric was beyond 580.0 °C and the fabric exhibited strong hydrophobicity (water contact angle 125.0°). The Fe3O4@CNTs/PANI/PI fabric possessed a minimum reflection loss (RL) value of −62.61 dB (>99.9 % absorption) with a matching thickness of 1.58 mm. The excellent microwave absorption capacity is attributed to the well impendence match, dielectric and magnetic loss, and the scattering loss of the special cell structure.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  Strong background noise, multiple interferences, and complex transmission paths contaminate weak early fault signatures of vibration signals from rotating machineries, hampering timely and effective fault detection, thus affecting operational safety. Although early fault signal enhancement methods have attracted attention, the traditional blind deconvolution (TBD) method remains sensitive to noise and impulsive interferences despite extensive research conducted. It often falls into local optima during iterative optimization, limiting its flexibility and reliability in enhancing early fault pulse components. Additionally, its heavy reliance on priori knowledge of repetitive pulse periods restricts its practical application. To address aforementioned issues, a multi-objective optimal deep deconvolution (MODD) method is introduced. A dual-branch collaborative deep convolutional network is constructed by the MODD method, which jointly optimizes the dual-branch collaborative deep convolutional network by employing the correlation kurtosis and the noise energy multi-objective loss function as the joint optimization objective. Furthermore, the MODD method precisely identified the fault periods of rotating machinery vibration signals during the optimization iterations by utilizing the autocorrelation function. By incorporating the proportion factor of fault pulse components, it determines the location of early fault pulse components. On this basis, the MODD method constructs vectors representing repetitive pulses and noise energy, reflecting the repetitive pulse and noise components that are closely associated with early faults. A multi-objective loss function is established to enhance pulse components and suppress interference, optimizing fault-related signals while mitigating the effects of noise and random pulses. The effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed MODD method are validated through experiments on rolling bearing fault signal collected from aero-engine accessory gearbox, and an enhanced performance is obtained when compared with traditional TBD methods.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  In the industrial and transportation sectors, fault diagnosis of diesel engines is critical to ensure their efficient and reliable operation. Current data-driven diesel engine fault diagnosis methods primarily rely on single-cylinder respective fault data to train diagnostic models for individual cylinders which face severe limitations regarding data availability. The limitation makes realizing all cylinder fault diagnoses with traditional models in practical engineering applications difficult. For this problem, the study proposes a whole machine fault diagnosis model for diesel engines based on mixed attention fusion multi-cylinder sensor data. The model not only incorporates single-cylinder sensor data through self-attention but also effectively fuses each cylinder’s signal features using the mutual attention mechanism. Simultaneously considering the mechanism knowledge of cylinder structural consistency and signal time delay similarity, this approach innovative utilizes single-cylinder fault data to develop a comprehensive fault recognition model for all cylinders. This enhances the accuracy and generalization capability of fault diagnosis at the whole-engine level, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods. In a simulated misfire experiment on the 12-cylinder V-type diesel engine, the proposed model demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 98.17%. This result validates the model’s ability to diagnose faults across all cylinders when only single-cylinder fault data is available. The proposed method holds significant importance for the application of diesel engine fault diagnosis technology in engineering practice.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  While deep learning-based fault detection methods for rolling body mechanical components have achieved good results, their application in real-world scenarios is limited, and their reliability is not satisfactory due to the non-interpretability of deep learning. Meanwhile, automated component vibration signals are usually affected by irregularities, which make it challenging to obtain advanced features by conventional feature extraction methods. To solve the above problems, we develop a new fuzzy cognitive graph model that combines the interpretability of fuzzy cognitive graphs with the high-precision categorization of hypergraphs, called fuzzy cognitive hypergraph (FCHG). First, frequency domain analysis is combined with graph analysis to help the network extract high-level features. Second, causal learning is used to construct the FCHG weight matrix to make the FCHG interpretable and enhance the reliability of fault diagnosis. Finally, the FCHG network is built using spectrogram theory and Chebyshev polynomial expansion to capture multiple feature relationships and improve fault diagnosis accuracy. The practicality and effectiveness of the FCHG model for monitoring the health and stability status of rolling body mechanical components are verified on three datasets.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  Deep learning-based methods have recently shown remarkable advancements in multi-exposure image fusion (MEF), demonstrating significant achievements in improving the fusion quality. Despite their success, the majority of reference images in MEF are artificially generated, inevitably introducing a portion of low-quality ones. Existing methods either utilize these mixed-quality reference images for supervised learning or heavily depend on source images for unsupervised learning, making the fusion results challenging to accurately reflect real-world illumination conditions. To overcome the impact of unreliable factors in references, we propose a self-adaptive mean teacher-based semi-supervised learning framework tailored for MEF, termed SAMT-MEF. Its self-adaptiveness is reflected from two perspectives. Firstly, we establish a self-adaptive set to retain the best-ever outputs from the teacher as pseudo labels, employing a well-crafted hybrid metric for its updates. Secondly, we employ contrastive learning to assist the self-adaptive set further in alleviating overfitting to inferior pseudo labels. Our proposed method, backed by abundant empirical evidence, outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively on both reference and non-reference datasets. Furthermore, in some scenarios, the fusion results surpass the reference images, showcasing superior performance in practical applications. Source code are publicly available at https://github.com/hqj9994ever/SAMT-MEF.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  Intelligent fault diagnosis, detection, and prognostics (DDP) for complex equipment prognostics and health management (PHM) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs. Equipment in industrial scenarios often operates in normal conditions, resulting in missing anomalies, limited failures, and incomplete degradation paths. Thus the limited information on the state of the equipment collected from sensor readings severely hinders the cognitive capabilities of discriminative artificial intelligence (AI) for PHM. Data augmentation and generation (DA&G) techniques, represented by generative AI, have shown great promise in overcoming the limitations of PHM application scenarios. Research on DA&G has yielded significant achievements, but a comprehensive review in the mechanical field is still lacking. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA&G techniques aimed at solving the DDP problems, which are divided into three categories insights of data, mechanism, and features. The data-based randomized approach applies controlled randomness for augmentation. The mechanism-based domain-specific techniques advocate for exploring relationships between the physical entity and monitoring data for generating by reasoned inference. The feature-based generative model aims to identify the latent space of data and subsequently resample it. Finally, the paper explores strategies for evaluating DA&G and provides a deep insight into the challenges and opportunities of DA&G techniques.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
                  In ground penetrating radar (GPR) images, the signals from reinforcing steel bars (rebars) can significantly obscure the signals of void defects beneath them, which hinders defect detection in tunnel linings. This study introduces a novel, end-to-end unsupervised deep learning-based network that is trained on unpaired GPR images. The primary objective is to suppress the rebar signal and enhance the accuracy of void defect identification in recorded GPR B-Scan images. The network incorporates an autoencoder generator with feature attention and feature mix-up modules, designed to recover textural information and generate improved images devoid of rebar interference. Crucially, this network leverages a strategy of comparing images in feature space, rather than pixel space. The features extracted by the autoencoder are constrained by cycle perceptual consistency loss, derived from a pretrained VGG19 network, to ensure fidelity and perceptual accuracy. Furthermore, this study introduces an enhanced Faster-RCNN network, specifically improved through a more robust feature extraction module, for detecting void defects beneath rebars. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been thoroughly validated using both synthetic and real-world data sets. The results indicate that our method not only surpasses other unsupervised techniques in performance but also effectively diminishes rebar signals and accurately reconstructs and identify void defect signals.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Underwater sound classification has been an area of interest in the research community because of its applications in military, commercial, and environmental domains. Underwater sound classification is a challenging task because of the high background noise and complex sound propagation patterns in the sea environment. For underwater sound classification, deterministic as well as stochastic techniques are being used. However, in recent years, stochastic techniques which are learning-based are getting a lot of attention. There exist few survey studies with a limited scope that cover the limited number of studies. In this study, we present the most comprehensive review of research and the latest developments in the field of underwater sound classification by highlighting the contributions and challenges from over 250 recent research papers. We discuss machine learning as well as deep learning-based methods for marine vessel sound classification and fish sound classification. The study also includes details of sources of underwater sound, features, classifiers, datasets, related techniques, challenges, and future trends.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>An updating method for data-driven based transient stability assessment model of power systems is proposed in this paper. To cope with potential faults in the real-time operation of power systems, the parameters of models can be modified online through the proposed method. Firstly, according to the long-short term memory (LSTM) network, transient stability assessment models are initially trained offline by expected faults. Then, the feature distribution differences between expected faults and potential faults are evaluated by the time-sequence maximum mean discrepancy (TMMD). Compared with the traditional maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), the proposed TMMD approach takes the temporal properties of transient stability into account, which can reflect the relationship between fault samples and time series better. Finally, the parameters of models are adjusted by transfer learning to reduce the feature distribution differences, by which the updated models can be more suitable for the different but related potential faults. Therefore, through the proposed model updating method, the extensibility of evaluation models is greatly enhanced, which is more in line with the practical conditions of power systems. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by the evaluation results in the IEEE 39-bus system and a realistic power system.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Enhancing our understanding of adversarial examples is crucial for the secure
application of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. A prevalent
method for analyzing adversarial examples is through a frequency-based
approach. However, existing research indicates that attacks designed to exploit
low-frequency or high-frequency information can enhance attack performance,
leading to an unclear relationship between adversarial perturbations and
different frequency components. In this paper, we seek to demystify this
relationship by exploring the characteristics of adversarial perturbations
within the frequency domain. We employ wavelet packet decomposition for
detailed frequency analysis of adversarial examples and conduct statistical
examinations across various frequency bands. Intriguingly, our findings
indicate that significant adversarial perturbations are present within the
high-frequency components of low-frequency bands. Drawing on this insight, we
propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm based on combining different
frequency bands. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets and models
demonstrate that combining low-frequency bands and high-frequency components of
low-frequency bands can significantly enhance attack efficiency. The average
attack success rate reaches 99\%, surpassing attacks that utilize a single
frequency segment. Additionally, we introduce the normalized disturbance
visibility index as a solution to the limitations of $L_2$ norm in assessing
continuous and discrete perturbations.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Identification of the causal relationship between multivariate time series is
a ubiquitous problem in data science. Granger causality measure (GCM) and
conditional Granger causality measure (cGCM) are widely used statistical
methods for causal inference and effective connectivity analysis in
neuroimaging research. Both GCM and cGCM have frequency-domain formulations
that are developed based on a heuristic algorithm for matrix decompositions.
The goal of this work is to generalize GCM and cGCM measures and their
frequency-domain formulations by using a theoretic framework for minimum
entropy (ME) estimation. The proposed ME-estimation method extends the
classical theory of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for stochastic
processes. It provides three formulations of cGCM that include Geweke's
original time-domain cGCM as a special case. But all three frequency-domain
formulations of cGCM are different from previous methods. Experimental results
based on simulations have shown that one of the proposed frequency-domain cGCM
has enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting network connections
compared to other methods. In an example based on in vivo functional magnetic
resonance imaging, the proposed frequency-domain measure cGCM can significantly
enhance the consistency between the structural and effective connectivity of
human brain networks.

  scattering problems</a></h1>

        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Hanle scattering is an important diagnostic tool to study weak solar magnetic
fields. Partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the
linear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle-averaged
PRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is
established that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret
polarization profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim
is to present an efficient decomposition technique, and the numerical method to
solve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem. Together with the
standard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the
outgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the
angle-dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of
angle-dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer
problem. Such an approach is self-consistent and accurate compared to a recent
approach where angle-averaged frequency domains were used to solve the same
problem. We show that it is necessary to incorporate angle-dependent frequency
domains instead of angle-averaged frequency domains to solve the Hanle transfer
problem accurately, especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance of
using angle-dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of
Hanle effect in the case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a
slab atmosphere. We have also studied the case of polarized line formation when
micro-turbulent magnetic fields are present. The difference between
angle-averaged and angle-dependent solutions is enhanced by the presence of
micro-turbulent fields.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Advances in virtual reality have generated substantial interest in accurately
reproducing and storing spatial audio in the higher order ambisonics (HOA)
representation, given its rendering flexibility. Recent standardization for HOA
compression adopted a framework wherein HOA data are decomposed into principal
components that are then encoded by standard audio coding, i.e., frequency
domain quantization and entropy coding to exploit psychoacoustic redundancy. A
noted shortcoming of this approach is the occasional mismatch in principal
components across blocks, and the resulting suboptimal transitions in the data
fed to the audio coder. Instead, we propose a framework where singular value
decomposition (SVD) is performed after transformation to the frequency domain
via the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). This framework not only
ensures smooth transition across blocks, but also enables frequency dependent
SVD for better energy compaction. Moreover, we introduce a novel noise
substitution technique to compensate for suppressed ambient energy in discarded
higher order ambisonics channels, which significantly enhances the perceptual
quality of the reconstructed HOA signal. Objective and subjective evaluation
results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework in

  Its Coherence</a></h1>

        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Most speech enhancement algorithms make use of the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT), which is a simple and flexible time-frequency decomposition
that estimates the short-time spectrum of a signal. However, the duration of
short STFT frames are inherently limited by the nonstationarity of speech
signals. The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration of speech
enhancement and automatic speech recognition in the presence of reverberation
and noise by extending the length of analysis windows. We accomplish this
extension by performing enhancement in the short-time fan-chirp transform
(STFChT) domain, an overcomplete time-frequency representation that is coherent
with speech signals over longer analysis window durations than the STFT. This
extended coherence is gained by using a linear model of fundamental frequency
variation of voiced speech signals. Our approach centers around using a
single-channel minimum mean-square error log-spectral amplitude (MMSE-LSA)
estimator proposed by Habets, which scales coefficients in a time-frequency
domain to suppress noise and reverberation. In the case of multiple
microphones, we preprocess the data with either a minimum variance
distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, or a delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB).
We evaluate our algorithm on both speech enhancement and recognition tasks for
the REVERB challenge dataset. Compared to the same processing done in the STFT
domain, our approach achieves significant improvement in terms of objective
enhancement metrics (including PESQ---the ITU-T standard measurement for speech
quality). In terms of automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance as
measured by word error rate (WER), our experiments indicate that the STFT with
a long window is more effective for ASR.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Robust tensor principal component analysis (RTPCA) can separate the low-rank
component and sparse component from multidimensional data, which has been used
successfully in several image applications. Its performance varies with
different kinds of tensor decompositions, and the tensor singular value
decomposition (t-SVD) is a popularly selected one. The standard t-SVD takes the
discrete Fourier transform to exploit the residual in the 3rd mode in the
decomposition. When minimizing the tensor nuclear norm related to t-SVD, all
the frontal slices in frequency domain are optimized equally. In this paper, we
incorporate frequency component analysis into t-SVD to enhance the RTPCA
performance. Specially, different frequency bands are unequally weighted with
respect to the corresponding physical meanings, and the frequency-weighted
tensor nuclear norm can be obtained. Accordingly we rigorously deduce the
frequency-weighted tensor singular value threshold operator, and apply it for
low rank approximation subproblem in RTPCA. The newly obtained
frequency-weighted RTPCA can be solved by alternating direction method of
multipliers, and it is the first time that frequency analysis is taken in
tensor principal component analysis. Numerical experiments on synthetic 3D

domain, or only take simple measures to align high-frequency information, which
can lead to distortion and low quality of the generated images. To solve these
problems, we propose a novel method called frequency domain decomposition
translation (FDDT). This method decomposes the original image into a
high-frequency component and a low-frequency component, with the high-frequency
component containing the details and identity information, and the
low-frequency component containing the style information. Next, the
high-frequency and low-frequency components of the transformed image are
aligned with the transformed results of the high-frequency and low-frequency
components of the original image in the same frequency band in the spatial
domain, thus preserving the identity information of the image while destroying
as little stylistic information of the image as possible. We conduct extensive
experiments on MRI images and natural images with FDDT and several mainstream
baseline models, and we use four evaluation metrics to assess the quality of
the generated images. Compared with the baseline models, optimally, FDDT can
reduce Fr\'echet inception distance by up to 24.4%, structural similarity by up
to 4.4%, peak signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.8%, and mean squared error by up
to 31%. Compared with the previous method, optimally, FDDT can reduce Fr\'echet
inception distance by up to 23.7%, structural similarity by up to 1.8%, peak
signal-to-noise ratio by up to 6.8%, and mean squared error by up to 31.6%.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Ultrachirped pulses for which the frequency chirp is of the order of the
transition frequency of a two-level atom are examined. When the chirp is large
enough, the resonance may be crossed twice, for positive and negative
quadrature frequencies. In this scenario the analytic signal and quadrature
decompositions of the field into amplitude and phase factors turn out to be
quite different. The corresponding interaction pictures are strictly
equivalent, but only as long as approximations are not applied. The domain of
validity of the formal rotating wave approximation is dramatically enhanced
using the analytic signal representation.

  Decomposition and Its Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation</a></h1>

        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is the mostly used model to formulate
the received tensor signal in a multi-domain massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system, as the receiver generally sums the components
from different paths or users. To achieve accurate and low-latency channel
estimation, good and fast CP decomposition algorithms are desired. The CP
alternating least squares (CPALS) is the workhorse algorithm for calculating
the CP decomposition. However, its performance depends on the initializations,
and good starting values can lead to more efficient solutions. Existing
initialization strategies are decoupled from the CPALS and are not necessarily
favorable for solving the CP decomposition. To enhance the algorithm's speed
and accuracy, this paper proposes a deep-learning-aided CPALS (DL-CPALS) method
that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to generate favorable initializations.
The proposed DL-CPALS integrates the DNN and CPALS to a model-based deep
learning paradigm, where it trains the DNN to generate an initialization that
facilitates fast and accurate CP decomposition. Moreover, benefiting from the
CP low-rankness, the proposed method is trained using noisy data and does not
require paired clean data. The proposed DL-CPALS is applied to millimeter wave
MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (mmWave MIMO-OFDM) channel
estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements of
the proposed method in terms of both speed and accuracy for CP decomposition
and channel estimation.

  Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection</a></h1>

        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  With the increased deployment of face recognition systems in our daily lives,
face presentation attack detection (PAD) is attracting much attention and
playing a key role in securing face recognition systems. Despite the great
performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in
intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen
scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks
(CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn
features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in
sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement
the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical
attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at
different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers
of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and
cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach
enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to
state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain
adaption/shift problems. We successfully prove the design of our proposed PAD
solution in a step-wise ablation study that involves our proposed learnable
frequency decomposition, our hierarchical attention module design, and the used
loss function. Training codes and pre-trained models are publicly released

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  There has been an increasing consensus in learning based face anti-spoofing
that the divergence in terms of camera models is causing a large domain gap in
real application scenarios. We describe a framework that eliminates the
influence of inherent variance from acquisition cameras at the feature level,
leading to the generalized face spoofing detection model that could be highly
adaptive to different acquisition devices. In particular, the framework is
composed of two branches. The first branch aims to learn the camera invariant
spoofing features via feature level decomposition in the high frequency domain.
Motivated by the fact that the spoofing features exist not only in the high
frequency domain, in the second branch the discrimination capability of
extracted spoofing features is further boosted from the enhanced image based on
the recomposition of the high-frequency and low-frequency information. Finally,
the classification results of the two branches are fused together by a
weighting strategy. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve
better performance in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings,
demonstrating the high generalization capability in various application
scenarios.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  MLP-like models built entirely upon multi-layer perceptrons have recently
been revisited, exhibiting the comparable performance with transformers. It is
one of most promising architectures due to the excellent trade-off between
network capability and efficiency in the large-scale recognition tasks.
However, its generalization performance to heterogeneous tasks is inferior to
other architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers) due to the extensive
retention of domain information. To address this problem, we propose a novel
frequency-aware MLP architecture, in which the domain-specific features are
filtered out in the transformed frequency domain, augmenting the invariant
descriptor for label prediction. Specifically, we design an adaptive Fourier
filter layer, in which a learnable frequency filter is utilized to adjust the
amplitude distribution by optimizing both the real and imaginary parts. A
low-rank enhancement module is further proposed to rectify the filtered
features by adding the low-frequency components from SVD decomposition.
Finally, a momentum update strategy is utilized to stabilize the optimization
to fluctuation of model parameters and inputs by the output distillation with
weighted historical states. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose
a MLP-like backbone for domain generalization. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate significant generalization performance, outperforming
the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3%, 4% and 9%, respectively.

  Adversarial Transferability</a></h1>

        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to
adversarial attacks, with frequency-domain analysis underscoring the
significance of high-frequency components in influencing model predictions.
Conversely, targeting low-frequency components has been effective in enhancing
attack transferability on black-box models. In this study, we introduce a
frequency decomposition-based feature mixing method to exploit these frequency
characteristics in both clean and adversarial samples. Our findings suggest
that incorporating features of clean samples into adversarial features
extracted from adversarial examples is more effective in attacking
normally-trained models, while combining clean features with the adversarial
features extracted from low-frequency parts decomposed from the adversarial
samples yields better results in attacking defense models. However, a conflict
issue arises when these two mixing approaches are employed simultaneously. To
tackle the issue, we propose a cross-frequency meta-optimization approach
comprising the meta-train step, meta-test step, and final update. In the
meta-train step, we leverage the low-frequency components of adversarial
samples to boost the transferability of attacks against defense models.
Meanwhile, in the meta-test step, we utilize adversarial samples to stabilize
gradients, thereby enhancing the attack's transferability against normally
trained models. For the final update, we update the adversarial sample based on
the gradients obtained from both meta-train and meta-test steps. Our proposed
method is evaluated through extensive experiments on the ImageNet-Compatible
dataset, affirming its effectiveness in improving the transferability of
attacks on both normally-trained CNNs and defense models.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Recently, attention mechanisms have been applied successfully in neural
network-based speaker verification systems. Incorporating the
Squeeze-and-Excitation block into convolutional neural networks has achieved
remarkable performance. However, it uses global average pooling (GAP) to simply
average the features along time and frequency dimensions, which is incapable of
preserving sufficient speaker information in the feature maps. In this study,
we show that GAP is a special case of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) on
time-frequency domain mathematically using only the lowest frequency component
in frequency decomposition. To strengthen the speaker information extraction
ability, we propose to utilize multi-frequency information and design two novel
and effective attention modules, called Single-Frequency Single-Channel (SFSC)
attention module and Multi-Frequency Single-Channel (MFSC) attention module.
The proposed attention modules can effectively capture more speaker information
from multiple frequency components on the basis of DCT. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets and a probe evaluation on
the 1st 48-UTD forensic corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed SFSC and MFSC attention modules can efficiently generate more
discriminative speaker representations and outperform ResNet34-SE and
ECAPA-TDNN systems with relative 20.9% and 20.2% reduction in EER, without
adding extra network parameters.

        <p>  Within the ambit of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) telecommunications,
the complexities introduced by acoustic transformations merit rigorous
analysis. This research, rooted in the exploration of proprietary sender-side
denoising effects, meticulously evaluates platforms such as Google Meets and

acoustic-phonetic perturbations within VoIP systems. To further ground the
implications of these transformations, psychoacoustic metrics, specifically
PESQ and STOI, were harnessed to furnish a comprehensive understanding of
speech alterations. Cumulatively, the insights garnered underscore the
intricate landscape of VoIP-influenced acoustic dynamics. In addition to the
primary findings, a multitude of metrics are reported, extending the research

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>  Spherical harmonics are a favorable technique for 3D representation,
employing a frequency-based approach through the spherical harmonic transform
(SHT). Typically, SHT is performed using equiangular sampling grids. However,
these grids are non-uniform on spherical surfaces and exhibit local anisotropy,
a common limitation in existing spherical harmonic decomposition methods. This
paper proposes a 3D representation method using Fibonacci Spherical Harmonics
(FSH). We introduce a spherical Fibonacci grid (SFG), which is more uniform
than equiangular grids for SHT in the frequency domain. Our method employs
analytical weights for SHT on SFG, effectively assigning sampling errors to
spherical harmonic degrees higher than the recovered band-limited function.
This provides a novel solution for spherical harmonic transformation on
non-equiangular grids. The key advantages of our FSH method include: 1) With
the same number of sampling points, SFG captures more features without bias
compared to equiangular grids; 2) The root mean square error of 32-degree
spherical harmonic coefficients is reduced by approximately 34.6\% for SFG
compared to equiangular grids; and 3) FSH offers more stable frequency domain
representations, especially for rotating functions. FSH enhances the stability
of frequency domain representations under rotational transformations. Its
application in 3D shape reconstruction and 3D shape classification results in
more accurate and robust representations.
